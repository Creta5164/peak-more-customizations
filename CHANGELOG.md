## 1.1.0

### Breaking change

Starting `1.1.0`, previous version of contents will incompatible, due refactoring data structure.

But this change was necessary for the future, and to be clear,
I and the contributors to the Discord PEAK modding community have worked together
to make it easier for you to create and distribute content.

If you've already created content,
please refer to the newly revised
[Build asset bundle](https://github.com/creta5164/peak-more-customizations/tree/main/docs/build-asset-bundle.md)
guide documentation.

Note that now prerequisites requires [Git](https://git-scm.com), please install Git before reading it.

Sorry for inconvenience.

Special thanks to IAmBatby, AriIcedT, LittleTurtle!
